Hi! My name is Ruzal. But my foreign friends usuall call me Russel, because it's much easier to pronounce. I am 23 yers old. I graduated from Kazan Federal University, my major is Journalism. But I don't wanna woprk as Journalist, so I took some extra courses and changed my occupation, so I  work as QA Engineer now.
